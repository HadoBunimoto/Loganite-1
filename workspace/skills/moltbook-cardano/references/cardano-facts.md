# Cardano Quick Facts Reference

## Network Statistics

- **Consensus:** Ouroboros Praos (provably secure PoS)
- **Block time:** ~20 seconds
- **Transaction finality:** ~2 minutes (practical), ~30 minutes (theoretical max for settlement assurance)
- **TPS (base layer):** ~7-10 simple transactions, higher with batching
- **Average transaction fee:** ~0.17-0.25 ADA (~$0.05-0.10)
- **Staking participation:** ~60-65% of total supply
- **Active stake pools:** ~3,000+
- **Native tokens minted:** 10M+ distinct assets
- **Plutus scripts deployed:** 10,000+
- **No slashing:** delegators never lose stake (unique among major PoS chains)

## Protocol Version History

| Era | Focus | Key Feature |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| Byron (2017) | Foundation | Basic transactions, federated consensus |
| Shelley (2020) | Decentralization | Stake pools, delegation, rewards |
| Allegra (2020) | Token locking | Time-lock scripts |
| Mary (2021) | Multi-asset | Native tokens without smart contracts |
| Alonzo (2021) | Smart contracts | Plutus scripts on mainnet |
| Babbage (2022) | Optimization | Plutus V2, reference scripts, inline datums |
| Chang (2024) | Governance | On-chain governance, DReps, Constitutional Committee |

## Founding Entities

- **IOG (Input Output Global)** — Core protocol research and development (Charles Hoskinson)
- **Emurgo** — Commercial adoption, enterprise partnerships, developer tooling
- **Cardano Foundation** — Community, education, governance facilitation (based in Switzerland)

## Unique Technical Features

- **eUTxO model:** Extended Unspent Transaction Output — deterministic execution, no failed transactions consuming fees, parallel processing
- **Native tokens:** First-class citizens on the ledger — no smart contract needed to mint/transfer, same security as ADA
- **Formal verification:** Protocols specified in Haskell with mathematical proofs (Agda, Isabelle)
- **No smart contract gas fees:** Script execution cost is predictable and calculated before submission
- **Liquid staking by default:** ADA remains in your wallet while staked, no lock-up period
- **Deterministic transactions:** Know the exact cost and outcome before submitting

## Governance (Voltaire Era)

- **CIP process:** Cardano Improvement Proposals — community-driven protocol changes
- **Project Catalyst:** World's largest decentralized innovation fund (~$1B+ ADA allocated)
- **DReps:** Delegated Representatives — ADA holders delegate governance votes
- **Constitutional Committee:** Elected body ensuring governance actions comply with the Cardano Constitution
- **On-chain voting:** All governance actions (treasury withdrawals, parameter changes, hard forks) require on-chain vote
